/*Welcome to the year 3017! Things have changed a lot in the last thousand years. Now people don't live only on the Earth. 
They live in many planets. And even more amazingly, they also live in many parallel universes which were discovered!

There is an infinite number of parallel universes, each of which has N planets. The planets inside a single universe are 
numbered from 1 to N. The planets inside a single universe are connected with each other by N-1 bi-directional tunnels in 
such a way that there's a path between any pair of planets within a single universe. The network of tunnels in every universe 
is the same. That is, if there is a tunnel between planets q1 and q2 in some universe, then there is a tunnel between planets 
q1 and q2 in every universe.

The universes are numbered starting from 1, while the planets in a single universe are numbered from 1 to N. Therefore a 
particular planet can be uniquely determined by its planet number inside the particular universe, and the number of the 
universe that it belongs to.

There are also M special bi-directional teleports that let you travel from one planet to another, and these could even be 
across different universes. Each teleport is defined by 4 numbers, p1, u1, p2, u2. This means that it can teleport you from 
the p1-th planet in u1-th universe to the p2-th planet in u2-th universe and also vice-versa.

All tunnels and special teleports take 1 unit of time to pass through.

Chef wants to find the shortest distance between two places. He has Q such queries that need to be answered. Try to help him 
with these.
