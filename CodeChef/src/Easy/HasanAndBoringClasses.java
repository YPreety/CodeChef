/*Hasan is a computer science student, he likes his study field, especially programming and algorithms, but he doesn’t like 
attending classes at all since they are very boring, especially that the quality of education in his college is extremely low, 
but sometimes he is forced to attend in order to maintain his attendance rate otherwise he will be prevented from doing final 
exams!

Currently Hasan is attending `communication skills` class and he is now feeling very bored especially that he thinks such course 
should not belong to a computer science program, luckily he remembered a problem that one of his friends has given him so he
decided to spend the time thinking about it, the problem states:

Given a string S of length N of lower English letters, find how many strings T exists of length N of lower English letters 
such that T is palindrome and hamming distance between T and S is at most K. since the answer is large find the remainder modulo
109 + 7

Since you also don’t like `communication skills` classes you decided to solve this problem too.
